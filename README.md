Planet In A File: Dashboards Are Dead

Contributor: Aashna Shimkhada

Project Description
This project explores how to replace traditional dashboards with a conversational, LLM‑driven interface. The goal is to design an LLM‑readable context file that summarizes Overture’s monthly release statistics, enabling users to ask natural‑language questions and receive accurate, data‑grounded answers. This repository is initialized to support collaboration and version control throughout the project.
